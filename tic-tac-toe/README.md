This is a basic version of the immensely popular Tic-Tac-Toe game. It runs on any machine that hosts Python 3.x and can be run from command line, IDE or Jupyter notebooks.
To run the game from command line, please down the entire tic-tac-toe folder and execute the following command from within the same path:
			python tic_tac_toe.py
To run from IDE, simply run it as you would run any other program. 

Feel free to mail me@kunal.jubce@gmail.com for any doubts or requests about the code. Happy Playing!
